If you reach here, first, thank you for visiting my little space and wanting to know a little more about me. In this place I will try to share some of my craziness, my projects, and some of my thoughts.

For now in the university, my likes go to networks, some security and sysadmin stuff, here I am learning how to study and learn about anything in IT world, but when it involves these topics, my heart tells me to go there.

Now my first focus is to finish my graduation, but I am looking for internships to start learning more about real life scenarious and help the business to grow with me.

For now, this part of my website will be only in english, but I wish to make this page entirely in my native language portuguese.
